# Simple Compiler Project in C++
## OWNER

## Overview

This project is a simple compiler written in C++ that demonstrates the fundamental concepts of compiler design, including lexical analysis, parsing, abstract syntax tree (AST) generation, and assembly code generation. It is designed for educational purposes and provides a basic framework for understanding how compilers work.

## Features

- **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenizes the source code into meaningful symbols.
- **Parsing**: Converts tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- **Code Generation**: Generates assembly-like code from the AST.
- **Basic Language Constructs**:
  - Variable declarations (e.g., `int a;`)
  - Assignments (e.g., `a = b + c;`)
  - Arithmetic operations (e.g., `+`, `-`)
  - Conditional statements (e.g., `if` statements)

## Compilation and Usage


# Prerequisites
A C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
A text editor or IDE for editing the source code
Compilation
To compile the project, navigate to the project directory in your command prompt or terminal and run the following command:

``g++ -o jitendra main.cpp lexer.cpp parser.cpp code_generator.cpp``

Running the Program
After successful compilation, you can run the program using:
``main``

# Input File
The program reads from a sample input file named input.txt. You can modify this file to test different inputs.

# Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements, bug fixes, or additional features, feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.
